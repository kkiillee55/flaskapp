currently it's my private repository
used to store latest code and do experiments on AWS

In this project, I build a blog website in Flask, which supports:
user register
user login
create/delete post
watch others' posts
comment/reply in posts
password reset

the database I use is MYSQL, which is the one that I learned in W4111 database course
but it doesn't require me to write MYSQL queries with SELECT/FROM/... because I'm ueing ORM here, so it's easy to change the databse with only few efforts

I'm trying to make it looks cooler in add-resume branch, maybe I should change this branch name to oldest version branch, because this one the the base of add-resume branch
